# Technical Research: WerwolfGame

**Created**: September 21, 2025
**Status**: Research Complete
**Prerequisites**: Completed business specification (Spec.md)

## Research Overview

### Research Scope
Comprehensive analysis covering SwiftUI game development patterns, game state management architectures, accessibility for shared device usage, and integration requirements within the existing Werwolf iOS project. Research focused on Apple platform technologies with emphasis on modern iOS development practices for turn-based social games.

### Key Findings Summary
SwiftUI ecosystem (iOS 16+) provides robust native support for all Werwolf game requirements. Key insights: @Observable pattern optimal for game state, NavigationStack ideal for phase management, Dynamic Type scaling supports diverse age groups, and clear UI design enables effective device sharing. No external dependencies required - pure SwiftUI implementation recommended.

## Codebase Integration Analysis

### Existing Architecture Patterns
Clean slate SwiftUI project with minimal foundation. Current patterns: 4-space indentation, SwiftUI-first approach with @Observable state management, MVVM architecture, and standard Xcode project structure. Project configured for universal iOS/macOS deployment (iOS 26.0+, macOS 26.0+) with no external dependencies.

### Related Existing Components
**Models**: No existing game models - clean implementation required
**Views**: ContentView.swift placeholder for game navigation entry point, WerwolfApp.swift standard SwiftUI app structure 
**Services**: No existing business logic - pure game logic implementation needed
**Navigation**: No established navigation patterns - opportunity to implement NavigationStack best practices

### Integration Requirements
**Files to Modify**: 
- `/Users/jeehut/Developer/TiryakiDemoApp/Werwolf/Werwolf/ContentView.swift` - Replace with game navigation
**New Files to Create**: Complete directory structure following Swift Guidelines:
- `Models/` - GameModel, PlayerModel, RoleModel, GamePhaseModel
- `Views/Setup/` - PlayerSetupView, RoleCustomizationView, GameStartView
- `Views/Game/` - GameStateView, NightPhaseView, DayPhaseView, RoleRevealView, VotingView
- `Views/Results/` - GameResultsView, EliminationView
- `Views/Components/` - PlayerListView, GameTimerView, GameProgressView
- `Extensions/` - ArrayExt, GameModelExt
- `Global/` - GameConstants, GameUtilities

**API Integration Points**: None - fully self-contained game implementation
**Data Flow**: Unidirectional with @Observable GameModel injected via environment, flowing down to all views

### Implementation Considerations
**Consistency Requirements**: Follow Context/Guidelines/Swift.md and SwiftUI.md patterns - @Observable state management, 4-space indentation, descriptive naming, SwiftUI-first architecture
**Potential Conflicts**: None identified - clean slate project
**Refactoring Needs**: None required - new feature implementation
**Testing Integration**: Implement Swift Testing framework for game logic, manual usability testing for shared device scenarios

**Last Updated**: Stable API, last major updates iOS 16
**Research Date**: September 21, 2025
**Community Sources**: Apple sample code, game development community articles

**Key Capabilities**:
- GKStateMachine for managing game phases (setup, day, night, voting, results)
- Built-in state transition validation and rules enforcement
- Integration with update loops for real-time game state management
- Type-safe state management with enum-based phase definitions

**Limitations**:
- Requires additional learning curve beyond basic SwiftUI state management
- May be overkill for simpler turn-based games
- Limited documentation for complex social game scenarios

**Best Practices**:
- Define clear state transition rules between game phases
- Combine with @Observable for UI reactivity
- Use for complex games with multiple interconnected phases

**Decision Rationale**: GameplayKit provides robust, tested state machine implementation ideal for Werwolf's complex phase management, but evaluation needed against simpler @Observable approach.

## API & Service Research

### No External APIs Required
**Research Date**: September 21, 2025
**Decision Rationale**: Based on specification requirements, WerwolfGame is designed as a fully offline, local multiplayer experience with no network dependencies.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Local-only gameplay**: All game data stored in device memory during active sessions
- **No user accounts**: Players identified by names entered at game start only
- **No data persistence**: Games are ephemeral with no history tracking
- **Privacy by design**: No external data transmission eliminates privacy concerns
- **Offline reliability**: No network requirements ensure consistent experience

**Benefits of API-free Architecture**:
- Simplified implementation and maintenance
- Enhanced privacy and security
- Consistent performance regardless of network conditions
- Reduced complexity and external dependencies
- Faster development and testing cycles
